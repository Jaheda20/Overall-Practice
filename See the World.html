        <p> <b>Life is all about experiences.</b> And unlike material things, experiences stay with us no matter where we go. Finding ways to make the most of our life experiences is a challenge that we face every day. As human beings, we like to put a value on the things we pursue. We like to feel that what we are doing has a meaning. This purpose is important to our well-being, as it’s from those experiences in life that we learn and grow. Pursuing what we love brings us invaluable life lessons about ourselves and the world around us.</p>
        <p>What is there more to love than traveling? Traveling is a unique experience as it's the best way to unplug from the pushes and pulls of daily life. It helps us to forget about our problems, frustrations, and fears at home. During our journey, we experience life in different ways.

        <h2> Travelling gives us a better understanding of the World</h2>
        <p> If you remain in your home town or country for your whole life, it is hard to fully comprehend the world. You will never get to experience other countries’ struggles, celebrations, and traditions. 
        </p>
        <p> You can argue that the media does show you these things. However, the media often portrays the negatives of a country, while the positive stories go unreported. Think about the war in Syria and how your current perceptions of the people and the country are. The media enables us to build walls and barriers to understanding. The only way to overcome this is to explore and see things for ourselves in the real world. </p>
